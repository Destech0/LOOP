# Control statement LOOP while-loops
while (something is true) {
     //Do something 
}
While-loops is the simplest type of loop; it works in-between the parathensis there is a statement and while that statement is true then the code inside the collybraces will run again until that statement is no longer true.
  var i=1;
  while (i<2) {
  console.log(i);
  I++;
  For-loops works similarly to while-loops but the difference is that instead of texting a condition it specifies the number of times a loop should run.
  for (i=0; i<2; I++) {
     //Do something
}
i=0; => Starting Point.
i=2; => Ending Point.
I++  => Changing direction
for (var i=1; i<2; i++) {
console.log(i);
}

Difference and when to use while-loops and for-loops.
While-loop is checking for a state while something is true, you want to repeatedly run an instruction while the program is in certain state; solution to the 99 bottles of beer song lyrics best describe the while-loop in the exercise.
                          WHILE 
For-loop is trying to iterate, you trying to run a piece of code many times and you are going to use the for-loops to kmow how many times; the Fibonacci Sequence Challenge best describe this exercise.
